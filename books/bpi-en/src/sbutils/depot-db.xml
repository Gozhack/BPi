depot-db.xml(4)                                                depot-db.xml(4)



NAME
       depot-db.xml


FILE FORMAT
       The ``depot-db.xml'' file contains the names of directories that should
       be  scanned  while  sb  queries  the  depot  for  programs.   The  path
       ``<dist>''  is  prepended  to  the depot path for all remote depots and
       local (file://) depots with a  distribution  version.   Beginning  from
       this  path, sb reads the ``depot-db.xml'' file and adds the path compo‐
       nents it specifies to the parent path as another depot to  looking  for
       programs  in.  By  providing  successive  ``depot-db.xml'' files in the
       path, sb is able to descend a directory hierarchy and  search  multiple
       directories for programs.

       The DTD for the XML file is as follows:
           <!ELEMENT depots (depot+)>
           <!ELEMENT depot EMPTY>
           <!ATTLIST depot
             arch          CDATA           #IMPLIED
             auto-include  CDATA            1"
             category      CDATA           #IMPLIED
             dist-ver      CDATA           #IMPLIED
             name          CDATA           #REQUIRED
             program       CDATA           #IMPLIED
             systype       CDATA           #IMPLIED
             revision      CDATA           #IMPLIED
             version       CDATA           #IMPLIED>


DEPOT ATTRIBUTES
       A depot element can have the following attributes:

       arch, systype
           Architecture  type for packages in the directory. Common values are
           the  GNU  system  triple  such   as   ``sparc-sun-solaris2.8''   or
           ``alpha-dec-osf5.1''.  There  is no predefined set of update types.
           As long as the application understands the type, any  name  can  be
           used.  arch is deprecated. Use systype instead.


       auto-include
           Whether  or not the directory should be traversed unless explicitly
           requested.


       category
           Update type. While this can be any value specifying an update type,
           it  is  usually  ``src''  to  specify a directory containing source
           code. As long as the application understands the type, any name can
           be used.


       dist-ver
           Distribution  version.  There is no predefined set of update types.
           As long as the application understands the type, any  name  can  be
           used.  Multiple distribution versions can reference the same direc‐
           tory (as used in the example below).


       name
           The directory name to traverse.


       program
           Program name. Short-circuit to support --oldstyle-dependency option
           in gen-sb-db.


       version
           Program  version.  Short-circuit  to  support --oldstyle-dependency
           option in gen-sb-db.


       revision
           Program revision. Short-circuit  to  support  --oldstyle-dependency
           option in gen-sb-db.
