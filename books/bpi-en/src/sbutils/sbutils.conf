NAME
       sbutils.conf


FILE FORMAT
       The  configuration  file,  located  by  default  in  ``/opt/TWWfsw/sbu‐
       tils13/etc/sbutils.conf'', contains defaults used by  the  sb  program.
       The  file is line-based -- that is, each newline-terminated line repre‐
       sents either a comment or a parameter. No line-continuation  syntax  is
       available.

       Comments  begin  with  a  hash,  `#'. All text from the hash forward is
       ignored.

       Variable assignments are of the form 'name = value' (single valued)  or
       is significant. Whitespace before or after the first equal sign is dis‐
       carded. Leading and trailing whitespace in a parameter  value  is  dis‐
       carded.  Variables that take multiple values have their value bracketed
       with braces, '[' and ']'. The list below details which  variables  take
       array values (even when assigning one value to a variable that can take
       more than one value, the braces are  required).   If  the  value  is  a
       string, it should be quoted ('"').


       bash-path = <path>
               Path  to  bash  program.  All  scripts are run through bash for
               cross-platform portability. Bash is invoked with  the  command-
               line  arguments  ``--noprofile''  and  ``--norc''  to limit the
               side-effects of system and user-settings.


       build-dir = <path>
               Path used to unpack source files to.


       check-sig = <boolean>
               Verify the GPG signature of  the  package.  Equivalent  to  the
               ``--check-sig''     command-line    option.    Use    of    the
               ``--gpg-keyring-path''   option   or    definition    of    the
               ``gpg-keyring-path'' variable is required with this option.


       depots = '[' <url> <url> ... ']'
               Software  depot  to  search  for  programs.  Equivalent  to the
               ``--depot'' command-line option.


       dist = <dist>
               Distribution to search for program in. The default CD distribu‐
               tion is ``cd''. For custom builds, ``<dist>'' will be the value
               assigned.


       dist-ver = '[' <ver> <ver> ... ']'
               Distribution version. Equivalent to the ``--dist-ver'' command-
               line option.


       dtd-dirs = '[' <path> <path> ... ']'
               List   of   paths   to   search  for  DTDs.  By  default,  only
               ``/opt/TWWfsw/sbutils13/share'' is searched.


       egd-socket = <path>
               Pathname to the socket the EGD/PRNGD daemons are listening  on.
               Equivalent to the ``--egd-socket'' command-line option.


       gpg-keyring-path = <path>
               Specifies  the  location of the GPG keyring. The usual location
               of the keyring is ~/.gnupg. However, for security  reasons,  we
               encourage  use  of  a dedicated directory for the keyring. This
               option is required  if  ``--check-sig''  is  given  or  if  the
               ``check-sig'' variable is defined.


       install-base
               Installation   base  directory.  Software  is  expected  to  be
               installed in a directory wholly owned by the software  program,
               ``[install  base]/[install  path]''.  The  installation prefix,
               combining the installation base and installation path is avail‐
               able as ``${SB_INSTALL_PREFIX}''.


       install-path
               Installation  path containing the name of the program. Software
               is expected to be installed in a directory wholly owned by  the
               software   program,   ``[install  base]/[install  path]''.  The
               installation path can contain multiple directory components and
               the  variable  ``${SB_INSTALL_NAME}'' which is substituted with
               the value of the ``<install-name>'' element.  The  installation
               prefix,  combining  the installation base and installation path
               is available as ``${SB_INSTALL_PREFIX}''.


       lib-path-component = <string>
               Library subdirectory to  search  under  dependency  prefix  for
               libraries.   When  the  ``var''  attribute  is  specified  in a
               ``<depend>'' element, the ``<var>_LIB'' variable is set  (where
               <var>  is  the value specified by the ``var'' attribute) if the
               ``lib'' subdirectory is found under the dependency  prefix.  If
               the  ``lib'' subdirectory is not the correct ``library'' direc‐
               tory to search in for the  existence  of  a  library,  then  an
               alternate diretory name must be specified, using this variable.
               For example, on x86_64 systems, ``lib64'' might be more  appro‐
               priate.


       lib-search-path-components = '[' <ver> <ver> ... ']'
               Like  ``lib-path-component'',  but  provides  a list of library
               directories to search.


       local-depot = <path>
               Specifies the location to a remote  repository  to  hold  files
               retrieved   when   the  depot  is  remote.  Equivalent  to  the
               ``--local-depot'' command-line option.


       login = <string>
               Login,  if  required,  to  remote  depot.  Equivalent  to   the
               ``--login'' command-line option.


       password = <string>
               Password,  if  required,  to  remote  depot.  Equivalent to the
               ``--password'' command-line option.


       proxy-host = <hostname>
               Hostname of proxy server. Equivalent  to  the  ``--proxy-host''
               command-line option.


       proxy-login = <string>
               Login,   if  required,  on  proxy  server.  Equivalent  to  the
               ``--proxy-login'' command-line option.


       proxy-password = <string>
               Password, if required,  on  proxy  server.  Equivalent  to  the
               ``--proxy-password'' command-line option.


       quilt = <boolean>
               Interpret patch paths ending with "/" as quilt-style patches.


       quilt-patches = <directory>
               Directory  to  search under the patch path, if it ends with "/"
               and ``quilt'' is true. It should match the $QUILT_PATCHES envi‐
               ronment variable or the ``QUILT_PATCHES'' variable in the quil‐
               trc file.


       rename-matching-install-prefix-entries = [0|1]
               If a program being installed installs to the same  installation
               prefix  as  a  program  that already exists in the installation
               database, rename the database entry to the new version.


       sftp-known-hosts-path = <string>
               Path to ``ssh_known_hosts'' file.


       sftp-private-key-path = <string>
               Path to ssh private key file.


       systype-path = <path>
               Path to the GNU config.guess script to determine the  architec‐
               ture type. The result is available in ${SB_SYSTYPE}.


       tmpbasedir = <string>
               Temporary  base directory to use when creating temporary files.
               Needed when package  payload  too  big  for  default  temporary
               directory  (/tmp  or  /var/tmp).  Equivalent  to  the  ``--tmp‐
               basedir'' command-line option.


       umask = <mask>
               Set default umask.


       unique-install-prefix = [0|1]
               Require --force if some version of program installed  with  the
               same installation prefix.


       verbose = <num>
               Increase verbosity of output. A higher value increases the ver‐
               bosity level.


SECTIONS
       The configuration file can contain brace-delimited sections to  specify
       specific  options  for  a distribution and the default environment. The
       ``depot'' section identifier is used to specify options specific  to  a
       given  depot,  the  ``dist-opts'' section identifier is used to specify
       options specific to a distribution, and the ``environment''  identifier
       is  used to specify variables to set in the environment during the con‐
       figure, build, and install process.

       The  ``dist-opts''  section   contains   an   additional   sub-section,
       ``systype'',  to  specify  platform-specific variables. The ``systype''
       variable takes a single argument containing the  GNU  platform  triplet
       (e.g.  sparc-sun-solaris2.9)  or a shell wildcard pattern used to patch
       the GNU platform triplet (e.g. *-solaris2.9). It can also be used  out‐
       side  of  the  ``dist-opts'' section to specify global defaults for all
       distributions.

       Sections are of the form 'section arg { ... }'.

           systype <platform> {
             name = value
           }

           depot <url> {
             name = value
             name = value
             ...
           }

           dist-opts <dist> {
             name = value
             name = value
             ...

             systype <platform> {
               name = value
             }
             ...
           }

           environment {
             var = value
             ...
           }

       Variable assignments made within a depot  section  refer  only  to  the
       ``<url>''  the depot is specified for. If a variable is not assigned to
       in a depot section, the global value assigned to the  variable  in  the
       configuration file is used. By allowing per-depot variable values, sbu‐
       tils can retrieve packages from multiple depots at  once  and  retrieve
       packages from different directories in all depots.

       Within   a   depot,   the  only  variables  unique  to  the  depot  are
       ``dist-ver'', ``login'', and ``password''. While  all  other  variables
       can  be assigned to and will be specific to the depot, they will not be
       used.

       Variable assignments made within a ``dist-opts'' section are applicable
       to the distribution (``<dist>'') indicated.

       Variable  assignments  made within a ``systype'' section are applicable
       to the platform (``<platform>'') indicated.

       If a variable is not assigned in a specific section, the  global  value
       is used as the default.

       Variables set in the ``environment'' section are available in the envi‐
       ronment for configure, build, test, and install, uninstall,  and  purge
       scripts. An exception is made to the rule in the beginning of the docu‐
       ment allowing the line continuation character '´ (example  below).  The
       only environment made available to build scripts apart from those spec‐
       ified in  the  ``environment''  section  are  ``DISPLAY'',  ``EDITOR'',
       ``HOME'',  ``IFS'',  ``PATH'', ``TERM'', ``TTY'', and ``TZ''. Variables
       specified in the ``environment'' section override existing definitions.


EXAMPLES
       Sample configuration file  to  build  software  in  the  ``/opt/build''
       directory using an installation prefix of ``/opt/TWWfsw/[package]''.
           build-dir = /opt/build
           dist = cd
           verbose = 1

           environment {
             PATH = "/opt/tww/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/vac/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:\
           /sbin:/usr/sbin:/etc:/usr/etc:/usr/openwin/bin:/usr/dt/bin:\
           /usr/bin/X11:/opt/imake/bin:/usr/ucb:/usr/bsd"
           }

           dist-opts cd {
             install-base = "/opt/TWWfsw"
             install-path = "${SB_INSTALL_NAME}"
           }
