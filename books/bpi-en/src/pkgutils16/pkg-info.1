DESCRIPTION
       The pkg-info utility displays information on installed packages.  It indicates whether or not the package
       is installed, what instances of the package are installed (runtine, info and man pages, online documenta‐
       tion, and local configuration files), what links have been created for the package in the common bin, in‐
       fo, and man directories, and the installation path component of the package.

       Packages  are  specified  by package name or ``<pkg-archive>''. The package name provided as input is ex‐
       pected to refer to a package in a depot specified with ``--depot'' or to a file on the local  filesystem.
       If  the version and revision number are not specified, the most recent version of the package is selected
       from the list of depots or the package database (if ``--depot'' was not specified). If the version number
       is specified but the revision number is not, the most recent revision of the package is selected from the
       list of depots or the package database.

       By default, only those packages installed in the package database are checked.


OPTIONS
       -e, --arg <arg>
            Additional arguments to pass to the package manager. Multiple instances of this option can  be  used
            to  pass additional arguments, such as ``-a TWW'' (i.e. -e -a -e TWW) to Solaris pkgadd or ``--relo‐
            cate xxx=yyy'' (i.e. -e --relocate -e xxx=yyy) to RPM. Each argument is passed as a quoted  argument
            to the package manager.


       --check-sig
            Verify  the  GPG  signature  of  the  package  and the ``depot-db.xml'' and ``pkg-db.xml'' files. If
            pkg-info does not find the ``gpg'' binary in the search path, installation will  fail.  If  the  GPG
            signature  verification fails, execution will stop. Before using this option, the public key used to
            sign the package must be present in your keyring. It is not necessary  for  the  public  key  to  be
            signed for signature verification to work. However, it is recommended that you sign the public key.


       -c, --config <path>
            Alternate     path     to     configuration    file.    The    default    path    is    ``/opt/TWWf‐
            sw/pkgutils16/etc/pkgutils.conf''.  The  format  of  the  configuration  file   is   documented   in
            pkgutils.conf(4).   pkg-info  uses  the  following  variables  in  the  configuration file: npkg-db,
            pkg-type, root, rpm-db.


       -s, --depot <depot>
            Software depot to search for packages. The path to the depot, ``<depot>'' is either a directory or a
            URL.  The  following  methods are supported: ``file://'', ``ftp://'', ``http://'', ``https://'', and
            ``sftp://''. Multiple software depots can be specified. Packages with dependencies do  not  need  to
            have their dependencies available in the same depot. However, all instances of a package are expect‐
            ed to be found in a given depot (thus, the man and runtime components of a package must exist in the
            same  depot).  The  depot specified, <depot>, is the top-level path to the depot.  Through the depot
            database file, ``depot-db.xml'', pkg-inst will descend into subdirectories of the depot  and  search
            in these directories for additional packages. Any path with the packages must have the package data‐
            base file, ``pkg-db.xml''. The format of the depot-db.xml file  is  documented  in  depot-db.xml(4).
            The  format  of  the  pkg-db.xml  file  is  documented in pkg-db.xml(4).  Unlike chk-pkg-updates and
            pkg-inst, the depots variable in the configuration file is not used. By  default,  pkg-info  queries
            the local package database.


       -G, --dist <dist>
            Distribution  to  query  from. The default distribution is ``cd''. When specified, ``<dist>'' is ap‐
            pended to the depot path. Also used to specify distribution-specific variables from  the  configura‐
            tion file in ``dist-opts'' section.

            -d, --dist-ver <ver> Distribution version to use when specifying a remote depot or a local reposito‐
            ry that mirrors a remote depot. The distribution version matches the release number for the packages
            to  install. The special keyword ``latest'' can be used to specify the most recent distribution ver‐
            sion.


       -E, --egd-socket <path>
            Pathname to the socket the EGD/PRNGD daemons are listening on. This is needed only if the remote de‐
            pot is being accessed through https and the platform does not have access to a /dev/random device.


       --global-pkg-db <path>
            Pathname  to global pkg-db.xml. The global pkg-db.xml file contains a list of all packages ever cre‐
            ated. The default path is ``/opt/TWWfsw/pkgutils16/share/pkg-db.xml''.


       --gpg-keyring-path <path>
            Specifies the location of the GPG keyring. The usual location of the keyring is  ~/.gnupg.  However,
            for  security reasons, we encourage use of a dedicated directory for the keyring. This option is re‐
            quired if --check-sig is given.


       -h, --help
            Displays short description of program options and then exits the program.


       -b, --install-base <dir>
            Specify the installation base directory where the package has been installed. The default  value  is
            ``/opt/TWWfsw''.  This option is needed only if the administrative ``basedir'' directory was changed
            on Solaris (cf.  admin(4)).  If the --relocate option was given for RPM packages, pkg-info will  au‐
            tomatically detect the relocated files by quering the RPM database.


       -l, --link-listing <type>
            Display  links  in  common  directories  that reference the given package.  A value of ``short'' for
            <type> displays a summary of what packages have links in the common bin, info, and man  directories.
            A  value  of  ``long'' for <type> displays a listing of all links installed in the common bin, info,
            and man directories. Multiple instances of this option may be specified.


       --list-package-names <type>
            List package names only, either in the repository if specified in conjuction  with  --depot  or  in‐
            stalled packages. Incompatible with --link-listing, --print, and --update-pkg-db. The output can ei‐
            ther be the ``name'' for the package name, ``name-ver'' for the package name and version, or ``name-
            ver-rev'' for the package name and version and revision.


       --local-depot <depot>
            Specifies  the  location  to a local directory to hold files retrieved from a remote repository. The
            files in the local depot are never removed. As a result, ``<depot>'' can be used later with --depot.
            If not specified, a temporary local depot is created and removed before pkg-info completes.


       --login <login>
            Login  for  a remote repository requiring authentication. For the ``ftp://'' method, a default login
            id of ``anonymous'' is used when no login id is specified. For the ``http://''  method,  HTTP  BASIC
            authentication is assumed.


       --npkg-db <dir>
            Path to Npkg database, if using the Npkg package management system.


       --password <pass>
            Password  for  a  remote repository requiring authentication. For the ``http://'' method, HTTP BASIC
            authentication is assumed.


       --pkg-db <path>
            Path to database of installed packages. In addition to the list of packages maintained by the  pack‐
            age management system, pkgutils maintains a list of packages installed with pkg-inst. This speeds up
            pkg-info, and pkg-rm. A global package database was available in pkgutils  1.3.x  which  contains  a
            list  of  all packages ever built and their dependencies. Unfortunately, this file must be read with
            every invocation of chk-pkg-updates, pkg-info, or pkg-rm making startup  times  slow.  In  addition,
            maintaining  this  file  for  every  package  ever built was unwieldy. If ``<path>'' is ''disable'',
            pkg-db.xml entries are ignored.


       -f, --pkg-list <file>
            Read <file> for a list of packages. This option can be specified multiple times. Package entries are
            specified one per line in <file>.


       -t, --pkg-type <type>
            Specify  an alternate package management system. If using the native package management system, this
            is unnecessary. If this option is not specified, pkg-info automatically determines the package  man‐
            agement system based on the platform it is running on. If using a non-native package management sys‐
            tem such as Npkg or RPM, this option must be specified. The  available  <type>s  are  ``depot''  for
            HP-UX  depot,  ``inst''  for  IRIX  inst, ``lpp'' for AIX, ``npkg'' for Npkg, ``pkgadd'' for Solaris
            pkgadd, ``rpm' for RPM, and ``setld'' for Tru64 UNIX setld.


       -p, --print <entry>
            Displays information about a package. Possible string values for <entry> are: ``changelog'' to  dis‐
            play package changelog (not the changelog for the program), ``dependencies'' to display dependencies
            for the package, ``description'' to display a description of the package, ``install-path''  to  dis‐
            play the installation path component for the package for the per-package configuration files located
            in ``/etc/opt/TWWfsw/configs/file'', ``licenses'' to display the program license(s),  and  ``notes''
            to display the program changelog and any notes specific to the program.


       --proxy-host <host>
            If  a  remote  repository is specified, use ``<host>'' as the proxy server if a proxy is required to
            connect to remote site.


       --proxy-login <login>
            Login for a proxy server required to connect with a remote repository.  For the ``ftp://'' method, a
            connection  is  initially made to the proxy host with the proxy login specified by ``<login>''. If a
            login to the remote repository is specified, the command ``USER <login>@<repository>'' is issued  to
            connect  to  the remote repository from the proxy server. If a login to the remote repository is not
            specified, the command ``USER anonymous@<repository>'' is issued. If a password to the remote repos‐
            itory  is  specified, the command `PASS <password>'' is issued to complete the connection to the re‐
            mote repository from the proxy server. If a password to the remote repository is not specified,  the
            command  ``PASS anonymous'' is issued.  For the ``http://'' method, HTTP BASIC authentication is as‐
            sumed.


       --proxy-password <pass>
            If the proxy host requires HTTP BASIC authentication, use ``<pass>'' as the password.

            -R, --root <path> Alternate root directory, as used when installing the package. This option is only
            applicable  under IRIX, HP-UX, and Solaris, whose package management systems allow specifying an al‐
            ternate root directory.


       --rpm-db <dir>
            Path to RPM database, if using the RPM package management system.


       --sftp-known-hosts-path <path>
            Path to ssh ``ssh_known_hosts'' file. When using the ``sftp://'' protocol for  remote  repositories,
            remote hosts are authenticated against the RSA/DSA host keys in this file. Because the sftp protocol
            implementation is done using the ``paramiko'' Python toolkit rather than interfacing  with  sftp(1),
            the path to the ssh ``ssh_known_hosts'' file must be specified.


       --sftp-private-key-path <path>
            Path  to ssh private key file for password-less access to remote repository. The private key must be
            created without a password as pkg-info does not prompt for passwords. The corresponding  public  key
            file  must exist in the ``.ssh/authorized_keys'' file on the remote host for either the user running
            pkg-info or for the user specified with ``--login'' option.


       --subpkgs <type>
            All components of a package are queried when no subpackage type is specified. The  available  compo‐
            nent <type>s are ``conf'' for local configuration files, ``doc'' for online documentation, ``librun‐
            time'' for the library runtime, ``man'' for GNU info and man pages, ``packages'' for 3rd-party pack‐
            ages, and ``runtime'' for the runtime component.


       -s, --systype <arch>
            Architecture  type for packages to display. Multiple instances of this option are supported. The ar‐
            chitecture type ``all'' represents all architectures, if using the Npkg package management system.


       --tmpbasedir <path>
            Temporary base directory to use when creating temporary files. Needed when package payload  too  big
            for  default  temporary directory (/tmp or /var/tmp). The TMPDIR environment variable is set to this
            path to propagate the use of the new temporary directory to the package management programs.


       -v, --verbose
            Provide more verbose diagnostics during program execution.


       -V, --version
            Display version number and exit.

               AutoGen is a tool designed for generating program files that
               contain repetitive text with varied substitutions. Its goal
               is to simplify the maintenance of programs that contain
               large amounts of repetitious text. This is especially
               valuable if there are several blocks of such text that must
               be kept synchronized. Output is specified with a
               Scheme-enhanced output template. Input, if required by your
               template, may come from AutoGen definitions, CGI data, or
               XML files.

               ---------------------------
               The latest LAN patch, PHNE_21217, should be installed.

               Platform notes: Tru64 UNIX
               --------------------------
               For Ethereal to work, the kernel must be compiled to support
               the packetfilter(7) pseudo-device driver. This is done by
               adding the option 'options PACKETFILTER' to your kernel
               configuration file in /sys/conf/[KERNEL CONFIG]. Once added,
               recompile the kernel with 'doconfig -c [KERNEL CONFIG]' and
               reboot to use the new kernel. The packetfilter devices must
               be created as well:
                 $ /bin/su
                 # cd /dev
                 # ./MAKEDEV pfilt

               Finally, the interface you wish to listen on must be allowed
               to enter promiscuous mode. This is done as follows:
                 # /usr/sbin/pfconfig +promisc [INTERFACE]
                 # /usr/sbin/pfconfig +copyall [INTERFACE]
