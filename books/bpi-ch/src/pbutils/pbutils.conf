pbutils.conf(4)                                                                                  pbutils.conf(4)



NAME
       pbutils.conf


FILE FORMAT
       The  configuration  file,  located  by  default  in  ``/opt/TWWfsw/pbutils11/etc/pbutils.conf'', contains
       defaults used by programs in the pbutils suite. The file is line-based -- that  is,  each  newline-termi‐
       nated line represents either a comment or a parameter. No line-continuation syntax is available.

       Comments begin with a hash, `#'. All text from the hash forward is ignored.

       Variable  assignments are of the form 'name = value' (single valued) or is significant. Whitespace before
       or after the first equal sign is discarded. Leading and trailing whitespace in a parameter value is  dis‐
       carded. Variables that take multiple values have their value bracketed with braces, '[' and ']'. The list
       below details which variables take array values (even when assigning one value to  a  variable  that  can
       take more than one value, the braces are required).


       bash-path = <path>
         Path to bash program. All pre/postinstall scripts are run through bash for cross-platform portability.


       cc = <path>
         Path to alternate compiler used by postinstall scripts.


       cflags = '[' <arg> <arg> ... ']'
         Alternate arguments to pass to compiler for compiled wrapper scripts.


       check-sig (boolean)
         Verify  the GPG signature of the package. Equivalent to the ``--check-sig'' command-line option. Use of
         the ``--gpg-keyring-path'' option or definition of the ``gpg-keyring-path'' variable is  required  with
         this option.


       depots = '[' <url> <url> ... ']'
         Software depot to search for programs. Equivalent to the ``--depot'' command-line option.


       dist = <dist>
         Distribution  to  search  for  program  in.  The  default CD distribution is ``cd''. For custom builds,
         ``<dist>'' will be the value assigned.


       dist-ver = '[' <ver> <ver> ... ']'
         Distribution version. Equivalent to the ``--dist-ver'' command-line option.


       egd-socket = <path>
         Pathname to the socket the EGD/PRNGD daemons are listening on.  Equivalent to the ``--egd-socket'' com‐
         mand-line option.


       gpg-keyring-path = <path>
         Specifies  the  location  of  the  GPG keyring. The usual location of the keyring is ~/.gnupg. However,
         because of http://www.securityportal.com/articles/advisory20010001.html, we encourage use  of  a  dedi‐
         cated directory for the keyring. This option is required if ``--check-sig'' is given or if the ``check-
         sig'' variable is defined.


       install-base = <path>
         Installation base directory. Software is expected to be installed in a directory wholly  owned  by  the
         software  program,  ``[install base]/[install path]''. The installation prefix, combining the installa‐
         tion base and installation path is available as ``${INSTALL_PREFIX}''.


       install-path = <path>
         Installation path containing the name of the program. Software is expected to be installed in a  direc‐
         tory wholly owned by the software program, ``[install base]/[install path]''. The installation path can
         contain multiple directory components and the variable ``${INSTALL_NAME}'' which  is  substituted  with
         the  value  of the ``<install-name>'' element. The installation prefix, combining the installation base
         and installation path is available as ``${INSTALL_PREFIX}''.


       local-depot = <path>
         Specifies the location to a remote repository to hold files retrieved when the depot is remote. Equiva‐
         lent to the ``--local-depot'' command-line option.


       login = <string>
         Login, if required, to remote depot. Equivalent to the ``--login'' command-line option.


       npkgmk-path = <path>
         Path to npkgmk program.


       npkgproto-path = <path>
         Path to npkgproto program.


       password = <string>
         Password, if required, to remote depot. Equivalent to the ``--password'' command-line option.


       pkg-types = '[' <type> <type> ... ']'
         Package management systems to build package for. Equivalent to the ``--pkg-type'' command-line option.


       pkgdir = <path>
         Directory to save packages to. Equivalent to the ``--pkgdir'' command-line option.


       pkgname-base-prefix = <string>
         Replace  ``${PKGNAME_BASE_PREFIX}'' in pb-db.xml(4) with <string>. Useful when part of the package name
         differs depending on the platform.


       proxy-host = <hostname>
         Hostname of proxy server. Equivalent to the ``--proxy-host'' command-line option.


       proxy-login = <string>
         Login, if required, on proxy server. Equivalent to the ``--proxy-login'' command-line option.


       proxy-password = <string>
         Password, if required, on proxy server. Equivalent to the ``--proxy-password'' command-line option.


       rpmbuild-path
         Path to RPM v4 "rpmbuild" program.


       systype-path = <path>
         Path to the GNU config.guess script to determine the architecture type.  The  result  is  available  in
         $SYSTYPE_PATH.


       tmpbasedir = <path>
         Path  to  the  base  directory  for  temporary files. By default, temporary files are created in either
         ``/tmp'' or ``/var/tmp''. However, for some package management systems like AIX lpp, files for a  pack‐
         age  must  be  copied into the temp directory. If the normal temporary directory is not large enough to
         hold the files, specify an alternate directory with this variable.


       verbose = <num>
         Increase verbosity of output. A higher value increases the verbosity level.


SECTIONS
       The configuration file can contain brace-delimited sections to specify specific options for  a  distribu‐
       tion.  The  ``depot''  section  identifier  is  used to specify options specific to a given depot and the
       ``dist-opts'' section identifier is used to specify options specific to a distribution.

       The ``dist-opts'' section contains an additional sub-section, ``systype'', to  specify  platform-specific
       variables.  The  ``systype''  variable  takes a single argument containing the GNU platform triplet (e.g.
       sparc-sun-solaris2.9) or a  shell  wildcard  pattern  used  to  patch  the  GNU  platform  triplet  (e.g.
       *-solaris2.9).  It  can  also be used outside of the ``dist-opts'' section to specify global defaults for
       all distributions.

       Sections are of the form 'section arg { ... }'.

         systype <platform> {
           name = value
         }

         depot <url> {
           name = value
           name = value
           ...
         }

         dist-opts <dist> {
           name = value
           name = value
           ...

           systype <platform> {
             name = value
             ...
           }

           ...
         }

       Variable assignments made within a depot section refer only to the ``<url>'' the depot is specified  for.
       If  a  variable  is  not assigned to in a depot section, the global value assigned to the variable in the
       configuration file is used. By allowing per-depot variable values, pbutils  can  retrieve  packages  from
       multiple depots at once and retrieve packages from different directories in all depots.

       Within  a  depot,  the  only variables unique to the depot are ``dist-ver'', ``login'', and ``password''.
       While all other variables can be assigned to and will be specific to the depot, they will not be used.

       Variable assignments made within a ``dist-opts'' section are applicable to the distribution  (``<dist>'')
       indicated.

       Variable  assignments  made  within a ``systype'' section are applicable to the platform (``<platform>'')
       indicated.

       If a variable is not assigned in a specific section, the global value is used as the default.


EXAMPLES
       Sample configuration file to build software in the ``/opt/build'' directory using an installation  prefix
       of ``/opt/TWWfsw/[package]'' and packages installed to ``/opt/dist/cd''.

         dist = cd

         dist-opts cd {
           dest-dir = "/opt/dist/cd"
           install-base = "/opt/TWWfsw"
           install-path = "${INSTALL_NAME}"
         }
