NAME
       pkg-rm - Remomve selected packages


SYNOPSIS
       pkg-rm [--add-all-packages] [--add-deps] [--add-reverse-deps] [-e|--arg=<arg>] [-c|--config=<path>]
              [-G|--dist=<dist>] [-N|--dry-run] [-h|--help] [--ignoredeps] [--npkg-db=<dir>] [--pkg-db=<path>]
              [-f|--pkg-list=<path>] [-t|--pkg-type=<type>] [-R|--root=<path>] [--rpm-db=<dir>]
              [--subpkgs=<type>] [--systype=<type>] [-v|--verbose] [-V|--version]
              [<package>[-<ver>[-<rev>]] ...]


DESCRIPTION
       The  pkg-rm  utility  provides  a  front end to the HP-UX swremove, IRIX versions, Solaris pkgrm, AIX in‐
       stallp, Tru64 UNIX setld, Npkg, and RPM package manager tools. It abstracts the package  removal  process
       through  the use of an XML package database that contains information about a package. It is the opposite
       of the pkg-inst tool.

       Multiple packages can be removed at once. When a package is selected for removal,  dependencies  will  be
       removed  if  --add-deps  is  specified  and  any  packages  that depend on the package will be removed if
       (--add-reverse-deps). Dependent packages are removed after the requested package.

       Packages  are  specified  by  package  name  and   an   optional   version,   revision   number   (<pack‐
       age>[-<ver>[-<rev>]]). If the version number is not specified, all installed versions of the package will
       be removed. If the revision number is  not  specified,  only  the  installed  version  matching  ``<pack‐
       age>-<ver>''  will be removed. If no packages are given, all installed packages are removed. The pkg-info
       command can be used to provide a list of packages.

       Packages are specified by package name and an optional version number (<package>[-<ver>]). If the version
       number  is  not  specified,  pkg-rm will remove all installed versions of the package. If no packages are
       given, all installed packages are removed.


OPTIONS
       --add-all-packages
            Remove all packages.


       --add-deps
            Remove the dependencies for a package. By default, pkg-rm will not remove the dependencies, but only
            the package itself.


       --add-reverse-deps
            Unless  the  --ignoredeps  option  is given, pkg-rm will refuse to remove a package with dependents.
            This option will automatically add all dependents to the package list and  remove  them  before  the
            package they are dependent on (the package with the dependents).

            -e, --arg <arg> Additional arguments to pass to the package manager. The default action of pkg-rm is
            to pass minimal arguments to the package manager, depending on the package management system. Multi‐
            ple  instances  of this option can be used to pass additional arguments, such as ``-a TWW'' (i.e. -e
            -a -e TWW) to Solaris pkgrm.  Each argument is passed as a quoted argument to the package manager.


       -c, --config <path>
            Alternate    path    to    configuration    file.    The    default     path     is     ``/opt/TWWf‐
            sw/pkgutils16/etc/pkgutils.conf''.   The   format   of  the  configuration  file  is  documented  in
            pkgutils.conf(4).


       -G, --dist <dist>
            Distribution to get information for. Used main to get distribution-specific variables in config file
            in ``dist-opts'' section.


       -N, --dry-run
            Indicate what actions would be performed but do not execute the actions. This is useful to determine
            what commands would be executed to remove the package without having the removal occur.


       -h, --help
            Displays short description of program options and then exits the program.


       --ignoredeps
            When a package with dependents is installed, pkg-rm will refuse to remove the package  unless  --ig‐
            noredeps is given. The rationale for this is because by removing the dependency, the packages depen‐
            dent on what was just removed are no longer functional. This option overrides the default  behavior.
            See also the --add-reverse-deps option.


       --npkg-db <dir>
            Path to Npkg database, if using the Npkg package management system.


       --pkg-db <path>
            Path  to database of installed packages. In addition to the list of packages maintained by the pack‐
            age management system, pkgutils maintains a list of packages installed with pkg-inst. This speeds up
            pkg-info,  and  pkg-rm.  A  global package database was available in pkgutils 1.3.x which contains a
            list of all packages ever built and their dependencies. Unfortunately, this file must be  read  with
            every  invocation  of  chk-pkg-updates,  pkg-info, or pkg-rm making startup times slow. In addition,
            maintaining this file for every package ever built  was  unwieldy.  If  ``<path>''  is  ''disable'',
            pkg-db.xml entries are not removed.


       -f, --pkg-list <file>
            Read <file> for a list of packages. This option can be specified multiple times.


       -t, --pkg-type <type>
            Specify  an alternate package management system. If using the native package management system, this
            is unnecessary. If this option is not specified, pkg-rm automatically determines the package manage‐
            ment system based on the platform it is running on. If you are using a non-native package management
            system such as Npkg or RPM, this option must be specified. The available <type>s are  ``depot''  for
            HP-UX  depot,  ``inst''  for  IRIX  inst, ``lpp'' for AIX, ``npkg'' for Npkg, ``pkgadd'' for Solaris
            pkgadd, ``rpm' for RPM, and ``setld'' for Tru64 UNIX setld.


       -R, --root <path>
            Alternate root directory, as used when installing the package. This option is only applicable  under
            IRIX, HP-UX, and Solaris, whose package management systems allow specifying an alternate root direc‐
            tory.


       --rpm-db <dir>
            Path to RPM database, if using the RPM package management system.


       --subpkgs <type>
            All components of a package are removed except when a dependency is being removed in which case only
            the  component required for the dependency is removed. If only a few of the available components are
            to be removed, multiple instances of this option should be used. The available component <type>s are
            ``conf'' for local configuration files, ``doc'' for online documentation, ``libruntime'' for the li‐
            brary runtime, ``man'' for GNU info and man pages, ``packages'' for 3rd-party packages,  and  ``run‐
            time'' for the runtime component.


       --systype <arch>
            Used to specify the host architecture type. Needed only if removing for an architecture type differ‐
            ent from the host architecture type (e.g. RPM). It could also be used to remove Solaris 2.9 packages
            on a Solaris 2.8 host.


       -v, --verbose
            Provide  more  verbose diagnostics during program execution.  pkg-rm uses the global pkg-db.xml file
            to determine what possible versions exist for a package. The default action is not to display infor‐
            mation  messages  as  pkg-rm  runs if the package does not exist but to limit such messages to those
            that exist. With this option, the status messages will display even for packages that do not exists.


       -V, --version
            Display version number of pkg-inst and exit.
