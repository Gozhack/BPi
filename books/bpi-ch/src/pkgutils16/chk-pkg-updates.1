DESCRIPTION
       The chk-pkg-updates utility checks for updates to installed packages.

       Packages  are  specified by package name or ``<pkg-archive>''. If the version and revision number are not
       specified, the most recent version of the package is selected from the list of  depots.  If  the  version
       number  is  specified but the revision number is not, the most recent revision of the package is selected
       from the list of depots. All versions of the package from the most recent available in the depot  to  the
       oldest  installed  will be checked. If no packages are given, all packages in all depots are checked. The
       ``<pkg-archive>'' path is given as either a local file or a URL (ftp, http, https, and sftp are  support‐
       ed).

       chk-pkg-updates  does  not  restrict checking for updates based on the instance of the installed package.
       Because a future version might have a different package instance, all versions beginning with the  oldest
       installed  version are checked. This usually displays more output that is necessary because more versions
       in the depot are checked. However, it offers a more complete picture about what updates are available.

       By default, only those packages installed are checked for updates. To check  updates  for  all  available
       packages, the ``--check-uninstalled'' option must be specified.


OPTIONS
       -e, --arg <arg>
            Additional  arguments  to  pass  to the package manager. The default action of chk-pkg-updates is to
            pass minimal arguments to the package manager, depending  on  the  package  management  system.  For
            pkgadd  under  Solaris, chk-pkg-updates uses a custom admin file via the ``-a'' option unless one is
            specified using this option.  Multiple instances of this option can be used to pass additional argu‐
            ments.


       --check-sig
            Verify  the  GPG  signature  of  the  package  and the ``depot-db.xml'' and ``pkg-db.xml'' files. If
            chk-pkg-updates does not find the ``gpg'' binary in the search path, installation will fail. If  the
            GPG signature verification fails, execution will stop. Before using this option, the public key used
            to sign the package must be present in your keyring. It is not necessary for the public  key  to  be
            signed for signature verification to work. However, it is recommended that you sign the public key.


       --check-uninstalled
            Do not restrict packages listed to those installed but to all available in the repository.


       -c, --config <path>
            Alternate     path     to     configuration    file.    The    default    path    is    ``/opt/TWWf‐
            sw/pkgutils16/etc/pkgutils.conf''.  The  format  of  the  configuration  file   is   documented   in
            pkgutils.conf(4).


       -s, --depot <depot>
            Software depot to search for packages. The path to the depot, ``<depot>'' is either a directory or a
            URL. The following methods are supported: ``file://'', ``ftp://'',  ``http://'',  ``https://'',  and
            ``sftp://''.  Multiple  software  depots can be specified. Packages with dependencies do not need to
            have their dependencies available in the same depot. However, all instances of a package are expect‐
            ed to be found in a given depot (thus, the man and runtime components of a package must exist in the
            same depot). The depot specified, <depot>, is the top-level path to the depot.   Through  the  depot
            database  file,  ``depot-db.xml'', chk-pkg-updates will descend into subdirectories of the depot and
            search in these directories for additional packages. Any path with the packages must have the  pack‐
            age  database  file,  ``pkg-db.xml''.  The  format  of  the  depot-db.xml  file is documented in de‐
            pot-db.xml(4).  The format of the pkg-db.xml file is documented in pkg-db.xml(4).  The default  list
            of depots is specified with the depots variable in the configuration file.


       -G, --dist <dist>
            Distribution  to  query  from. The default distribution is ``cd''. When specified, ``<dist>'' is ap‐
            pended to the depot path. Also used to specify distribution-specific variables from  the  configura‐
            tion file in ``dist-opts'' section.


       -d, --dist-ver <ver>
            Distribution version to use when specifying a remote depot (ftp://, http://, etc.) or a local repos‐
            itory that mirrors a remote depot. The distribution version matches the release number for the pack‐
            ages  to install. The special keyword ``latest'' can be used to specify the most recent distribution
            version.


       -E, --egd-socket <path>
            Pathname to the socket the EGD/PRNGD daemons are listening on. This is needed only if the remote de‐
            pot is being accessed through https and the platform does not have access to a /dev/random device.


       --gpg-keyring-path <path>
            Specifies  the  location of the GPG keyring. The usual location of the keyring is ~/.gnupg. However,
            for security reasons, we encourage use of a dedicated directory for the keyring. This option is  re‐
            quired if --check-sig is given.


       -h, --help
            Displays short description of program options and then exits the program.


       --local-depot <depot>
            Specifies  the  location  to a local directory to hold files retrieved from a remote repository. The
            files in the local depot are never removed. As a result, ``<depot>'' can be used later with --depot.
            If not specified, a temporary local depot is created and removed before chk-pkg-updates completes.


       --login <login>
            Login  for  a remote repository requiring authentication. For the ``ftp://'' method, a default login
            id of ``anonymous'' is used when no login id is specified. For the ``http://''  method,  HTTP  BASIC
            authentication is assumed.


       --npkg-db <dir>
            Path to Npkg database, if using the Npkg package management system.


       --password <pass>
            If the remote repository requires HTTP BASIC authentication, use ``<pass>'' as the password.


       --pkg-db <path>
            Path  to database of installed packages. In addition to the list of packages maintained by the pack‐
            age management system, pkgutils maintains a list of packages installed with pkg-inst. This speeds up
            pkg-info,  and  pkg-rm.  A  global package database was available in pkgutils 1.3.x which contains a
            list of all packages ever built and their dependencies. Unfortunately, this file must be  read  with
            every  invocation  of  chk-pkg-updates,  pkg-info, or pkg-rm making startup times slow. In addition,
            maintaining this file for every package ever built  was  unwieldy.  If  ``<path>''  is  ''disable'',
            pkg-db.xml entries are ignored.


       -f, --pkg-list <file>
            Read <file> for a list of packages. This option can be specified multiple times.


       -t, --pkg-type <type>
            Specify  an alternate package management system. If using the native package management system, this
            is unnecessary. If this option is not specified, chk-pkg-updates automatically determines the  pack‐
            age  management system based on the platform it is running on. If you are using a non-native package
            management system such as Npkg or RPM, this option must be  specified.  The  available  <type>s  are
            ``depot''  for  HP-UX  depot, ``inst'' for IRIX inst, ``lpp'' for AIX, ``npkg'' for Npkg, ``pkgadd''
            for Solaris pkgadd, ``rpm' for Redhat RPM, and ``setld'' for Tru64 UNIX setld.


       --proxy-host <host>
            If a remote repository is specified, use ``<host>'' as the proxy server if a proxy  is  required  to
            connect to remote site.


       --proxy-login <login>
            Login for a proxy server required to connect with a remote repository.  For the ``ftp://'' method, a
            connection is initially made to the proxy host with the proxy login specified by ``<login>''.  If  a
            login  to the remote repository is specified, the command ``USER <login>@<repository>'' is issued to
            connect to the remote repository from the proxy server. If a login to the remote repository  is  not
            specified, the command ``USER anonymous@<repository>'' is issued. If a password to the remote repos‐
            itory is specified, the command `PASS <password>'' is issued to complete the connection to  the  re‐
            mote  repository from the proxy server. If a password to the remote repository is not specified, the
            command ``PASS anonymous'' is issued.  For the ``http://'' method, HTTP BASIC authentication is  as‐
            sumed.


       --proxy-password <pass>
            If the proxy host requires HTTP BASIC authentication, use ``<pass>'' as the password.


       -R, --root <path>
            Alternate  root directory, as used when installing the package. This option is only applicable under
            IRIX, HP-UX, and Solaris, whose package management systems allow specifying an alternate root direc‐
            tory.


       --rpm-arch <arch>
            Specify  the  architecture type of the package being checked for RPM.  When installing RPM packages,
            chk-pkg-updates automatically determines the name that RPM uses to denote the  architecture  of  the
            RPM  package.  When installing RPM packages for a non-native host, such as installing HP-UX packages
            on a Solaris host, it is not possible to determine the RPM architecture name. This option  overrides
            the  automatic  detection.  Possible  values  for  <arch> are ``alpha'' for Tru64 UNIX, ``i386'' for
            RHEL/x86, SLES/x86, and Solaris/x86, ``ia64'' for HP-UX/IA,  ``mipseb''  for  IRIX,  ``parisc''  for
            HP-UX/PA, ``ppc'' for AIX, ``sparc'' for Solaris, and ``x86_64'' for RHEL/x86-64 and SLES/x86-64.


       --rpm-db <dir>
            Path to RPM database, if using the RPM package management system.


       --sftp-known-hosts-path <path>
            Path  to  ssh ``ssh_known_hosts'' file. When using the ``sftp://'' protocol for remote repositories,
            remote hosts are authenticated against the RSA/DSA host keys in this file.


       --sftp-private-key-path <path>
            Path to ssh private key file for password-less access to remote repository. The private key must  be
            created  without a password as chk-pkg-updates does not prompt for passwords. The corresponding pub‐
            lic key file must exist in the ``.ssh/authorized_keys'' file on the remote host for either the  user
            running chk-pkg-updates or for the user specified with ``--login'' option.


       --subpkgs <type>
            All  components  of  a package are checked except when a dependency is being installed in which case
            only the component required for the dependency is installed. If only a few of the  available  compo‐
            nents are to be installed, multiple instances of this option should be used. The available component
            <type>s are ``conf'' for local configuration files, ``doc'' for online documentation, ``libruntime''
            for  the  library  runtime, ``man'' for GNU info and man pages, ``packages'' for 3rd-party packages,
            and ``runtime'' for the runtime component.


       --systype <arch>
            Used to specify the host architecture type. Needed only if installing for an architecture type  dif‐
            ferent  from  the  host  architecture  type (e.g. RPM). It could also be used to install Solaris 2.6
            packages on a Solaris 2.5.1 host. Unless the depot is remote or the depot points to a  mirror  of  a
            remote repository, this option is unnecessary.


       --tmpbasedir <path>
            Temporary  base  directory to use when creating temporary files. Needed when package payload too big
            for default temporary directory (/tmp or /var/tmp). The TMPDIR environment variable is set  to  this
            path to propagate the use of the new temporary directory to the package management programs.


       --update-type <type>
            By  default, all update defined in the ``depot-db.xml'' file are searched for packages. The possible
            values for ``<type>'' are ``errata'' for fixes to the distribution, ``packages''  for  all  packages
            associated  with  a distribution, ``security'' for security fixes, ``support'' for support utilities
            such as pkgutils, ``test'' for test releases, and ``updates'' for updates to the distribution.  When
            an  update  occurs,  new  packages  will be installed into either ``errata'', ``security'', or ``up‐
            dates''.


       -v, --verbose
            Provide more verbose diagnostics during program execution. The second level (option specified twice)
            prints  out  information  about what depots are being read and any sub-depots being recursed into as
            the ``depot-db.xml'' file is parsed.


       -V, --version
            Display version number of chk-pkg-updates and exit.
