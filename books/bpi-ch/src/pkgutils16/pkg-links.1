NAME
       pkg-links - Install/remove links in common bin, info, man directories


SYNOPSIS
       pkg-links [-e|--arg=<arg>] [-c|--config=<path>] [--dist=<dist>] [-h|--help] [-b|--install-base=<path>]
                 [--npkg-db=<dir>] [--pkg-db=<path>] [-f|--pkg-list=<path>] [-t|--pkg-type=<type>]
                 [-R|--root=<path>] [--rpm-db=<dir>] [--subpkgs=<type>] [--systype=<arch>] [-u|--uninstall]
                 [-v|--verbose] [-V|--version] [<package>[-<ver>] ...]


DESCRIPTION
       The pkg-links utility installs and removes links in the common bin, info, and man directories  for  pack‐
       ages  provided  by  The  Written  Word.  Packages  shipped  by  The  Written Word contain postinstall and
       postremove scripts to automatically install and remove the links  at  package  installation  and  removal
       time.  For  some package management systems, it is not possible to execute the postinstall and postremove
       scripts independent of installing and removing the package.  Thus, if the links need to be  installed  or
       removed,  the  package must be installed or removed. This utility executes the postinstall and postremove
       scripts independent of the package management system. The HP-UX depot and Tru64 UNIX setld  systems  pro‐
       vide  this ability in their package management systems so pkg-links is merely a front-end for these pack‐
       age management systems.

       Packages  are  specified  by  package  name  and   an   optional   version,   revision   number   (<pack‐
       age>[-<ver>[-<rev>]]). If the version number is not specified, all installed versions of the package will
       be configured. If the revision number is not specified, only  the  installed  version  matching  ``<pack‐
       age>-<ver>'' will be configured.  The pkg-info command can be used to provide a list of packages.

       The default action of pkg-links is to create the common links.


OPTIONS
       -c, --config <path>
            Alternate     path     to     configuration    file.    The    default    path    is    ``/opt/TWWf‐
            sw/pkgutils16/etc/pkgutils.conf''.  The  format  of  the  configuration  file   is   documented   in
            pkgutils.conf(4).   pkg-links  uses  the  following  variables  in  the configuration file: npkg-db,
            pkg-type, root, rpm-db.


       -e, --arg <arg>
            Additional arguments to pass to the package manager. This serves a similar purpose to the same argu‐
            ment  provided  by  the pkg-inst command. Its use is primarily to add arguments to the RPM and HP-UX
            package managers. By default, no arguments are passed to the package manager. Multiple instances  of
            this option can be used to pass additional arguments.


       --dist <dist>
            Distribution to get information for. Used main to get distribution-specific variables in config file
            in ``dist-opts'' section.


       -h, --help
            Displays short description of program options and then exits the program.


       -b, --install-base <dir>
            Specify the installation base directory where the package has been installed. The default  value  is
            ``/opt/TWWfsw''.  This option is needed only if the administrative ``basedir'' directory was changed
            on Solaris (cf.  admin(4)).  If the --relocate option was given for RPM packages, pkg-links will au‐
            tomatically detect the relocated files by quering the RPM database.


       --npkg-db <dir>
            Path to Npkg database, if using the Npkg package management system.


       --pkg-db <path>
            Path  to database of installed packages. In addition to the list of packages maintained by the pack‐
            age management system, pkgutils maintains a list of packages installed with pkg-inst. This speeds up
            pkg-info,  and  pkg-rm.  A  global package database was available in pkgutils 1.3.x which contains a
            list of all packages ever built and their dependencies. Unfortunately, this file must be  read  with
            every  invocation  of  chk-pkg-updates,  pkg-info, or pkg-rm making startup times slow. In addition,
            maintaining this file for every package ever built  was  unwieldy.  If  ``<path>''  is  ''disable'',
            pkg-db.xml entries are ignored.


       -f, --pkg-list <file>
            Read <file> for a list of packages. This option can be specified multiple times. Package entries are
            specified one per line in <file>.


       -t, --pkg-type <type>
            Specify an alternate package management system. If using the native package management system,  this
            is unnecessary. If this option is not specified, pkg-links automatically determines the package man‐
            agement system based on the platform it is running on. If using a non-native package management sys‐
            tem  such  as  Npkg  or  RPM, this option must be specified. The available <type>s are ``depot'' for
            HP-UX depot, ``inst'' for IRIX inst, ``lpp'' for AIX, ``npkg''  for  Npkg,  ``pkgadd''  for  Solaris
            pkgadd, ``rpm' for RPM, and ``setld'' for Tru64 UNIX setld.

            -R, --root <path> Alternate root directory, as used when installing the package. This option is only
            applicable under IRIX, HP-UX, and Solaris, whose package management systems allow specifying an  al‐
            ternate root directory.


       --rpm-db <dir>
            Path to RPM database, if using the RPM package management system.


       --subpkgs <type>
            The ``man'', ``packages'', and ``runtime'' components of a package are configured when no subpackage
            type is specified. The available component <type>s are ``man'' for GNU info and man  pages,  ``pack‐
            ages'' for 3rd-party packages, and ``runtime'' for the runtime component.


       -s, --systype <arch>
            Architecture  type for packages to display. Multiple instances of this option are supported. The ar‐
            chitecture type ``all'' represents all architectures, if using the Npkg package management system.


       -u, --uninstall <arch>
            As stated above, the default action is to install the links in the common bin, info, and man  direc‐
            tories.  With  this  option,  the links are removed. It is safe to rerun this option after the links
            have already been removed.


       -v, --verbose
            Provide more verbose diagnostics during program execution.  pkg-links uses the package  database  to
            determine  what possible versions exist for a package. The default action is not to display informa‐
            tion messages as pkg-links runs if the package does not exist but to limit such  messages  to  those
            that exist. With this option, the status messages will display even for packages that do not exists.


       -V, --version
            Display version number and exit.

       tive package management system:

               ...
             removing links in info, man for TWWtxi43m:
               ...

         $ pkg-info --link-listing=short texinfo
