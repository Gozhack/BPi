DESCRIPTION
       The pkg-inst utility provides a front end to the  AIX  installp,  HP-UX  swinstall,  IRIX  inst,  Solaris
       pkgadd,  Tru64  UNIX  setld,  Npkg,  and RPM package manager tools. It abstracts the package installation
       process through the use of an XML package database that contains information about a package.

       When a package is selected for installation, dependencies will automatically  be  installed  (only  those
       components  of  the  package required to meet the dependency) Dependent packages are installed before the
       requested package.

       Packages are specified by package name or ``<pkg-archive>''. If the version and revision number  are  not
       specified,  the  most  recent  version of the package is selected from the list of depots. If the version
       number is specified but the revision number is not, the most recent revision of the package  is  selected
       from  the  list  of depots. The pkg-info command can be used to provide a list of package versions. If no
       packages are given, all packages in all depots are installed. The ``<pkg-archive>'' path is given as  ei‐
       ther a local file or a URL (ftp, http, https, and sftp are supported).

       For RPM packages, pkg-inst always uses the -U option to perform the initial installation and upgrades.


OPTIONS
       -e, --arg <arg>
            Additional  arguments  to  pass  to  the package manager installation program. The default action of
            pkg-inst is to pass minimal arguments to the package manager depending  on  the  package  management
            system.  Multiple  instances  of  this option can be used to pass additional arguments, such as ``-a
            TWW'' (i.e. -e -a -e TWW) to Solaris  pkgadd  or  ``--relocate  xxx=yyy''  (i.e.  -e  --relocate  -e
            xxx=yyy) to RPM. Each argument is passed as a quoted argument to the package manager.

            If  ``--remove-prev-ver''  is specified in addition to this option, and if the pkgmgr-args-inst con‐
            figuration variable is set, additional arguments passed to the pkg-rm command will be taken from the
            pkgmgr-args configuration variable, if specified.


       --check-sig
            Verify  the  GPG  signature  of  the  package  and the ``depot-db.xml'' and ``pkg-db.xml'' files. If
            pkg-inst does not find the ``gpg'' binary in the search path, installation will  fail.  If  the  GPG
            signature verification fails, execution will stop, even if additional packages are scheduled for in‐
            stallation. Before using this option, the public key used to sign the package  must  be  present  in
            your  keyring.   It  is  not necessary for the public key to be signed for signature verification to
            work. However, it is recommended that you sign the public key.


       -c, --config <path>
            Alternate    path    to    configuration    file.    The    default     path     is     ``/opt/TWWf‐
            sw/pkgutils16/etc/pkgutils.conf''.   The   format   of  the  configuration  file  is  documented  in
            pkgutils.conf(4).


       -s, --depot <depot>
            Software depot to search for packages. The path to the depot, ``<depot>'' is either a directory or a
            URL.  The  following  methods are supported: ``file://'', ``ftp://'', ``http://'', ``https://'', and
            ``sftp://''. Multiple software depots can be specified. Packages with dependencies do  not  need  to
            have their dependencies available in the same depot. However, all instances of a package are expect‐
            ed to be found in a given depot (thus, the man and runtime components of a package must exist in the
            same  depot).  The  depot specified, <depot>, is the top-level path to the depot.  Through the depot
            database file, ``depot-db.xml'', pkg-inst will descend into subdirectories of the depot  and  search
            in these directories for additional packages. Any path with the packages must have the package data‐
            base file, ``pkg-db.xml''. The format of the depot-db.xml file  is  documented  in  depot-db.xml(4).
            The  format  of  the  pkg-db.xml file is documented in pkg-db.xml(4).  The default list of depots is
            specified with the depots variable in the configuration file.


       -G, --dist <dist>
            Distribution to update from. The default distribution is ``cd''. When specified, ``<dist>''  is  ap‐
            pended  to  the depot path. Also used to specify distribution-specific variables from the configura‐
            tion file in ``dist-opts'' section.


       -d, --dist-ver <ver>
            Distribution version to use when specifying a remote depot (ftp://, http://, etc.) or a local repos‐
            itory that mirrors a remote depot. The distribution version matches the release number for the pack‐
            ages to install. The special keyword ``latest'' can be used to specify the most recent  distribution
            version.


       -N, --dry-run
            Indicate what actions would be performed but do not execute the actions. This is useful to determine
            what commands would be executed to install the package without having the installation occur.


       -E, --egd-socket <path>
            Pathname to the socket the EGD/PRNGD daemons are listening on. This is needed only if the remote de‐
            pot is being accessed through https and the platform does not have access to a /dev/random device.


       --extract <path>
            Extract  raw  packages from pkg-inst payload and copy to directory specified by ``<path>''. See "EX‐
            TRACTING RAW PACKAGES" below.


       --gpg-keyring-path <path>
            Specifies the location of the GPG keyring. The usual location of the keyring is  ~/.gnupg.  However,
            for  security reasons, we encourage use of a dedicated directory for the keyring. This option is re‐
            quired if --check-sig is given.


       -h, --help
            Displays short description of program options and then exits the program.


       --ignoredeps
            When a package with dependencies is installed, pkg-inst will search the list of available depots for
            any  dependencies that need to be installed matching the dependency criteria for the package. If de‐
            pendencies are met and need to be installed, pkg-inst will delay the  installation  of  the  current
            package until the dependencies are installed. This option bypasses this logic and installs the pack‐
            age irrespective of any dependencies to install. A message indicating what dependencies  are  needed
            will still be displayed along with a message that installation is proceeding because this option was
            given.


       --local-depot <depot>
            Specifies the location to a local directory to hold files retrieved from a  remote  repository.  The
            files in the local depot are never removed. As a result, ``<depot>'' can be used later with --depot.
            If not specified, a temporary local depot is created and removed before pkg-inst completes.


       --login <login>
            Login for a remote repository requiring authentication. For the ``ftp://'' method, a  default  login
            id  of  ``anonymous''  is used when no login id is specified. For the ``http://'' method, HTTP BASIC
            authentication is assumed.


       --match-target <option>
            Restrict package installation by ``name'' and/or ``package''. This option is similar  to  the  HP-UX
            swinstall  "Match  what  target  has" option. It allows blind installation of many packages with the
            confidence that only newer versions of already installed packages will be installed. One  caveat  to
            this  is  a  package needed to satisfy a dependency. If a package meets a dependency requirement, it
            will be installed regardless of whether or not a version already exists.

            If the value ``name'' is selected, package installation will be restricted to those  packages  whose
            names,  not  package  instances, match those already installed. The package name is the same as that
            given as a package name to pkg-inst when installing a specific package.  As long as some version  of
            the  package  is installed, installation will proceed. If ``package'' is also specified, in addition
            to installing the package if some version of the package is installed, only those instances  of  the
            installed packaged will be installed.

            If  the  value  ``package'' is selected, package installation will be restricted to instances of the
            package are already installed. If the ``<ver>'' portion of the package name is  given  as  input  to
            pkg-inst,  unless  the  instance of the package for the specified version is installed, installation
            will fail. However, if ``<ver>'' is not specified, pkg-inst will check if any version of the package
            has  been  installed  and,  if so, install the latest version matching the installed instance of the
            package.  Normally, pkg-inst installs the most recent version.  With  ``--match-target=package''  in
            effect,  only the latest version of the installed package instance can be installed, which might not
            be the latest version of the package.


       --npkg-db <dir>
            Path to Npkg database, if using the Npkg package management system.


       --password <pass>
            Password for a remote repository requiring authentication. For the ``http://''  method,  HTTP  BASIC
            authentication is assumed.


       --pkg-db <path>
            Path  to database of installed packages. In addition to the list of packages maintained by the pack‐
            age management system, pkgutils maintains a list of packages installed with pkg-inst. This speeds up
            pkg-info,  and  pkg-rm.  A  global package database was available in pkgutils 1.3.x which contains a
            list of all packages ever built and their dependencies. Unfortunately, this file must be  read  with
            every  invocation  of  chk-pkg-updates,  pkg-info, or pkg-rm making startup times slow. In addition,
            maintaining this file for every package ever built  was  unwieldy.  If  ``<path>''  is  ''disable'',
            pkg-db.xml entries are not written.


       -f, --pkg-list <file>
            Read <file> for a list of packages. This option can be specified multiple times.


       -t, --pkg-type <type>
            Specify  an alternate package management system. If using the native package management system, this
            is unnecessary. If this option is not specified, pkg-inst automatically determines the package  man‐
            agement system based on the platform it is running on. If you are using a non-native package manage‐
            ment system such as Npkg or RPM, this option must be specified. The available <type>s are  ``depot''
            for  HP-UX depot, ``inst'' for IRIX inst, ``lpp'' for AIX, ``npkg'' for Npkg, ``pkgadd'' for Solaris
            pkgadd, ``rpm' for RPM, and ``setld'' for Tru64 UNIX setld.


       --proxy-host <host>
            If a remote repository is specified, use ``<host>'' as the proxy server if a proxy  is  required  to
            connect to remote site.


       --proxy-login <login>
            Login for a proxy server required to connect with a remote repository.  For the ``ftp://'' method, a
            connection is initially made to the proxy host with the proxy login specified by ``<login>''.  If  a
            login  to the remote repository is specified, the command ``USER <login>@<repository>'' is issued to
            connect to the remote repository from the proxy server. If a login to the remote repository  is  not
            specified, the command ``USER anonymous@<repository>'' is issued. If a password to the remote repos‐
            itory is specified, the command `PASS <password>'' is issued to complete the connection to  the  re‐
            mote  repository from the proxy server. If a password to the remote repository is not specified, the
            command ``PASS anonymous'' is issued.  For the ``http://'' method, HTTP BASIC authentication is  as‐
            sumed.


       --proxy-password <pass>
            If the proxy host requires HTTP BASIC authentication, use ``<pass>'' as the password.


       --reinstall
            Prior  to  installing a package, pkg-inst checks if the package is already installed. If so, and the
            installed version is not greater than the version in the depot, the package is skipped. If the  ver‐
            sion in the depot is newer, the package is installed. This option will reinstall the package regard‐
            less of the version in the depot.


       --remove-prev-ver
            Remove older versions of successfully installed packages. This is done by  accumulating  a  list  of
            successfully  installed packages, determining the list of all older versions from the global package
            database, and passing the list to the pkg-rm program for removal once pkg-inst has installed all re‐
            quested packages.


       -R, --root <path>
            Alternate  root directory, as used when installing the package. This option is only applicable under
            IRIX, HP-UX, and Solaris, whose package management systems allow specifying an alternate root direc‐
            tory.


       --rpm-arch <arch>
            Specify the architecture type of the package being installed for RPM.  When installing RPM packages,
            pkg-inst automatically determines the name that RPM uses to denote the architecture of the RPM pack‐
            age.  When installing RPM packages for a non-native host, such as installing HP-UX packages on a So‐
            laris host, it is not possible to determine the RPM architecture name. This option overrides the au‐
            tomatic  detection.  Possible values for <arch> are ``alpha'' for Tru64 UNIX, ``i386'' for RHEL/x86,
            SLES/x86, and Solaris/x86, ``ia64'' for HP-UX/IA, ``mipseb''  for  IRIX,  ``parisc''  for  HP-UX/PA,
            ``ppc'' for AIX, ``sparc'' for Solaris, and ``x86_64'' for RHEL/x86-64 and SLES/x86-64.


       --rpm-db <dir>
            Path to RPM database, if using the RPM package management system.


       --sftp-known-hosts-path <path>
            Path  to  ssh ``ssh_known_hosts'' file. When using the ``sftp://'' protocol for remote repositories,
            remote hosts are authenticated against the RSA/DSA host keys in this file.


       --sftp-private-key-path <path>
            Path to ssh private key file for password-less access to remote repository. The private key must  be
            created  without  a password as pkg-inst does not prompt for passwords. The corresponding public key
            file must exist in the ``.ssh/authorized_keys'' file on the remote host for either the user  running
            pkg-inst or for the user specified with ``--login'' option.


       --subpkgs <type>
            All  components of a package are installed except when a dependency is being installed in which case
            only the component required for the dependency is installed. If only a few of the  available  compo‐
            nents are to be installed, multiple instances of this option should be used. The available component
            <type>s are ``conf'' for local configuration files, ``doc'' for online documentation, ``libruntime''
            for  the  library  runtime, ``man'' for GNU info and man pages, ``packages'' for 3rd-party packages,
            and ``runtime'' for the runtime component.


       --systype <arch>
            Used to specify the host architecture type. Needed only if installing for an architecture type  dif‐
            ferent  from  the  host  architecture  type (e.g. RPM). It could also be used to install Solaris 2.9
            packages on a Solaris 2.8 host. Unless the depot is remote or the depot points to a mirror of a  re‐
            mote repository, this option is unnecessary.


       --tmpbasedir <path>
            Temporary  base  directory to use when creating temporary files. Needed when package payload too big
            for default temporary directory (/tmp or /var/tmp). The TMPDIR environment variable is set  to  this
            path to propagate the use of the new temporary directory to the package management programs.


       --update-type <type>
            By  default, all update defined in the ``depot-db.xml'' file are searched for packages. The possible
            values for ``<type>'' are ``errata'' for fixes to the distribution, ``packages''  for  all  packages
            associated  with  a distribution, ``security'' for security fixes, ``support'' for support utilities
            such as pkgutils, ``test'' for test releases, and ``updates'' for updates to the distribution.  When
            an  update  occurs,  new  packages  will be installed into either ``errata'', ``security'', or ``up‐
            dates''.


       -v, --verbose
            Provide more verbose diagnostics during program execution. The second level (option specified twice)
            prints  out  information  about what depots are being read and any sub-depots being recursed into as
            the ``depot-db.xml'' file is parsed.


       -V, --version
            Display version number of pkg-inst and exit.


DEPOTS
       pkg-inst can install packages using its own package format (which encapsulates the vendor format) and the
       format of the native package management system. If pkg-inst is invoked without a distribution version, it
       interprets the depot as containing packages in the native vendor format. This is somewhat weak but a com‐
       promise allowing both methods had to be devised. Else, pkg-inst expects to find a package built using its
       package format.


FAILED/PARTIALLY INSTALLED PACKAGES
       Various package management systems handle failed and partially installed packages differently. All  pack‐
       ages considered failed or partially installed are treated as uninstalled packages to pkgutils.


EXTRACTING RAW PACKAGES
       The  ``--extract''  option  can be used to extract the raw packages from the ``.pkg-inst'' payload useful
       for installation using the native package management system. Depending on the platform, copying  the  raw
       packages to the destination directory differs. The following explains what happens:


       AIX (lpp format)
            LPP  package files are copied into the destination directory replacing files with the same name. LPP
            package filenames are named ``TWW.[package].bff''. Because a separate package  name  is  not  always
            created  for  multiple  versions  of  the  same  package  (e.g. libpng 1.2.29.  and libpng 1.3.4 are
            ``TWW.libpng12.bff''), copying a package might overwrite an older or newer version in  the  destina‐
            tion directory. Once the package is copied, the inutoc command is run against the destination direc‐
            tory to create the table of contents of all packages in the destination directory, making the  pack‐
            ages suitable for installation with installp.


       IRIX (inst format)
            Inst  packages  generally  comprise  four files, ``TWW[package]'', ``TWW[package].idb'', ``TWW[pack‐
            age].sw'', and ``TWW[package].man''.  The ``TWW[package].man'' file exists if the  package  contains
            either  man pages, info pages, or other documentation. Because a separate package name is not always
            created for multiple versions of  the  same  package  (e.g.  libpng  1.2.29  and  libpng  1.3.4  are
            ``TWWlibpng12''), copying a package might overwrite an older or newer version in the destination di‐
            rectory.


       HP-UX (depot format)
            HP-UX packages are either files or entries in a software depot. In the former case, the  depot  file
            is  copied  to  the destination directory, replacing an existing version in the destination with the
            same name. Because a separate package name is not always created for multiple versions of  the  same
            package  (e.g.  libpng  1.2.29  and libpng 1.3.4 are ``TWWlibpng12.depot''), copying a package might
            overwrite an older or newer version in the destination directory. Packages in a  ``.pkg-inst''  pay‐
            load  are always files. If the HP packages is an entry from a software depot, the destination direc‐
            tory is expected to be a software depot and the swcopy(1M) command is used to transfer the package.


       Solaris (pkgadd format)
            Solaris packages are either files or directories. Packages in a  ``.pkg-inst''  payload  are  always
            files.  When copying to the destination directory, the pkgtrans(1) command is used to copy the pack‐
            age in file system format to the destination directory. Because a separate package name is  not  al‐
            ways  created  for  multiple  versions  of the same package (e.g. libpng 1.2.29 and libpng 1.3.4 are
            ``TWWpng12''), copying a package might overwrite an older or newer version in the destination direc‐
            tory.  Packages  in  file  system  format (directories) and datastream format (individual files) are
            copied into the destination directory in file system format to make installation as simple as:
               $ pkgadd -d [destination directory] [package] [[package] ...]

       If copying the files in datastream format, the pkgadd(1M) command would have to  be  executed  for  every
       package to be installed.


       Tru64 UNIX (setld format)
            Tru64  UNIX  packages  exists  as  a  directory  of  one package or multiple packages. Packages in a
            ``.pkg-inst'' payload are always created as a directory of one package (the latter format,  multiple
            packages in a directory is not supported). Prior to copying the raw package files to the destination
            directory, a directory name in the destination with the same name is removed. This ensures no  files
            remain  from  an existing package after the files are copied. Because a separate package name is not
            always created for multiple versions of the same package (e.g. libpng 1.2.29 and  libpng  1.3.4  are
            ``TWWLIBPNG12''), copying a package might overwrite an older or newer version in the destination di‐
            rectory.


       RHEL, SLES, and others (RPM format)
            Due to the filename convention for RPM packages, multiple versions of a package might exist  in  the
            destination  directory (e.g. libpng 1.2.29 appears as TWWlibpng12-1.2.29-* and libpng 1.2.30 appears
            as TWWlibpng12-1.2.30-*). Because RPM packages are individual files for each sub-package  component,
            each file is copied to the destination directory.

             removing temporary files ... done

       If the --ignoredeps option is not given, pkg-inst will attempt to install all dependencies by first post‐
       poning the installation of the package with the dependencies, installing the dependencies, and  then  re-
       attempting  installation of the postponed package. When dependencies are installed, only those subpackage
       components that meet the dependency criteria are installed.

       pkg-archve files can be specified on the command-line rather than the package name for  installation.  If
       multiple  .pkg-inst archive files are specified, dependencies are expected to be resolved between the in‐
       put files. The example below installs libpng 1.2.29 on AIX 6.1:
           $ pkg-inst libpng-1.2.29-1.lpp.pkg-inst

CAVEATS
       The --remove-prev-ver option is executed after installation is complete. This  increases  the  amount  of
       disk space required for an installation. Removing packages immediately after a successful installation is
       ideal but impossible as a package to be installed later in the same run might depend on the package  just
       removed.
