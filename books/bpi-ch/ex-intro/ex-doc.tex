\label{ex:doc}
\Question
Go's documentation can be read with the \prog{go doc} program, which is
included the Go distribution.

\prog{go doc hash} gives information about the \package{hash} package:
\vskip\baselineskip
\begin{display}
\pr \user{go doc hash}
PACKAGE

package hash

...
...
...

SUBDIRECTORIES

        adler32
        crc32
        crc64
        fnv

\end{display}
\vskip\baselineskip
With which \prog{go doc} command can you read the documentation of \package{fnv} contained in
\package{hash}?

\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
\Question
The package \package{fnv} is in a \emph{subdirectory} of
\package{hash}, so you will only need\quad \texttt{go doc hash/fnv}.

Specific functions inside the ``Go manual'' can also be accessed. For
instance the function \func{Printf} is described in \package{fmt}. To
view the documentation for this function alone use: \prog{go doc fmt Printf}{} .

All the built-in functions are also accesible by using \prog{go doc builtin}.
\end{Answer}
