We are a team of Linux enthusiasts with decades of experience in embedded software and passion for open source software. 

Based on the experiences on Raspberry Pi* board, we would like to have a better hardware capabilities single borad computer by our own design. Meanwhile, we also target to have multiple OS supported for different preference of developers.

Our mission is to start with low-cost and more hardware capabilities  of Banana Pi.  Then we could foster lots of contributions in educational, industrial, scientific fields from time to time.
