BPi (Banana Pi)

We are a team of Linux enthusiasts with decades of experience in embedded software and passion for open source software. 

Based on the experiences on Raspberry Pi* board, we would like to have a better hardware capabilities single borad computer by our own design. So...Banana Pi jumps into the world!  

Meanwhile, we also target to have multiple OS supported for different preferences of developers.  With removable SD card, Banana Pi can boot up with your favorite OS such as Lubuntu, Raspbien, Archlinux, openSUSE, Android and so on. 

Our mission is to start with low-cost and more hardware capabilities of Banana Pi. Then we could foster contributions in educational, industrial, scientific fields from time to come.
